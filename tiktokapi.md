#### The TikTok API

TikTok does not yet have an API devoted to online research. However, we can 
use the commercially-oriented API to access data about TikTok users.

* [https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/overview/](TikTok's documentation)

TikTok will steer you towards setting up an App. Add the Login Kit and TikTok
API to your App.

We are currently stuck trying to figure out a URL for our app.


#### What data is available? 

- Public account data, such as user profiles, comments, and performance data including: comments, likes, and favorites
- Public content data, such as comments, captions, subtitles, and performance including: number of comments, shares, likes,
  and favorites.


#### Some important TikTok API Guidelines

- The TikTok Research API Data must be regularly refreshed at least every fifteen/(15) days.
- Data that is not availabel from the TikTok Research API at the time of each refresh must be deleted.
- Data must not be kept for longer than necessary for Research approved as part of your application.
- You agree to provide TikTok with written certification of data deletion upon TikTok's request.

#### What can you publish in your research?

- You may create derivative research outputs that are not speicifcally and directly made available through the service.
- You may not publish your research outputs if they violate the Research API terms. 
- You and your partners must provide attribution to TikTok in your research output/publications that use data derived 
  from the user of services.

### Ask the Office of Research Red Zone: I think this rule is iffy with the UC Patent Acknowledgement
- You agree TikTok and its affiliates will have a worldwide, free, nonexclusive, perpetual or for the maximum term allowed by 
  local law, sublicenseable, unlimited license to use the Qualified Research Partner name and logos, other identiying information, 
  and to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, transmite, display, and create derivative works from your Research in whole or 
  in part of any legitimate business purpose without notice.
