# Mastodon

Mastodon is social media and micro-blogging platform often compared to Twitter.
Unlike Twitter, Mastodon is open source software distributed with a license that
allows anyone to run a Mastodon server themselves. There is no "official"
Mastodon service; instead, users may sign-up with one of the many existing
Mastodon communities, or they may start their own by self-hosting the server
application. The site, [https://joinmastodon.org/servers](https://joinmastodon.org/servers), allows you to search for Mastodon servers by region, topic, and open signup status.

## Activity Pub

Mastodon is based on ActivityPub, a protocol for building decentralized social media applications. ActivityPub is an open standard, formally published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [in 2018](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-activitypub-20180123/). it "provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and content."
